# CheckMate2.0

### Overview
This project is a cross discipline capstone at BYU within the School of Technology. It is a self contained chess playing robot built with a custom board and enclosure. It is intended to be used as a recruiting tool for the school of Technology. 

#### File Structure
* run.py - Start of the main program. 
* *.py - The supporting classes used to run the chess game.
* config.ini - Robot settings and offsets to the board 
* config - Doxygen config file to generate documentation
* GameScripts/ - PGN files that will be used to play each chess game
* html/ - Documentation generated by doxygen 
* extra/ - Additional features that need further development
* tests/ - Tests written for classes. (most will need to be moved in main folder to run)
* notes/ - Additional notes

### Adding Games
To add additional games add PGN files to the GameScripts folder

### Autostart
Python has as trouble running scripts on boot so a few hacks need to be made in order for it to work
* Set up a cronjob by running `crontab -e` and adding the line `@reboot python3 /path/to/run.py`
* In run.py change line 5 set Autostart to True
* In run.py change line 6 set ProjectPath to the path of run.py in the project
* In config.ini set autostart to True

### Debugging
In order to debug the run the program without the robots make the following changes
* In run.py change the global testMode variable to True
* In board.py change comment out the line `from gpio import GPIOBOARD`

### Hardware
The following hardware components were used to build this project
* Raspberry Pi
* Two UArm Swift Pro Robots
* Reed switches
* Custom chess pieces
* Custom enclosure
