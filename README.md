# CheckMate2.0

### TODO
- Get the board class filled out and added to the robot. (robot class)
- Separate out peice class for other classes to use 
- With each move update Pieces on board (board class)
- Check for collision with each move (board class)
- Add collision routine when a collision happens (robot/board class/collision board class?)
- Add a routine that will check the GPIO pins after each move (gpio/board class)
- Create a function for the invert moves of the other robot (position class)
- Figure out how to auto detect which ports each of the robots are using 
- Think of a simple interface that reset the robot when needed
	- Piece of hardware that will trigger an interrupt on a RPI to reset all of the state
