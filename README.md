# CheckMate2.0

### TODO
- Combine both of the board classes into one class
- Implment the board reset
- Add a routine that will check the GPIO pins after each move (gpio/board class)
- Think of a simple interface that reset the robot when needed
	- Piece of hardware that will trigger an interrupt on a RPI to reset all of the state
